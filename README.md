## Project Overview

In this project, we developed and fine-tuned 23 NLP models for both English and Japanese languages, achieving remarkable accuracy rates of 90% for English and 70% for Japanese. We seamlessly integrated these custom NLP models into the Haystack framework, significantly enhancing the system's capabilities. The implementation of the BART model further optimized question-answering tasks in Haystack, resulting in a noticeable boost in performance.

## Key Features

- Developed and fine-tuned 23 NLP models with impressive accuracy rates.
- Integrated custom NLP models into the Haystack open-source framework.
- Implemented the BART model to enhance question-answering tasks.
- Received highly positive user feedback on accuracy and effectiveness improvements.
- Utilized LLM models and Haystack framework for project implementation.

## Setup

To set up the project and utilize the integrated NLP models with Haystack:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the installation instructions provided by the Haystack framework. (https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)
